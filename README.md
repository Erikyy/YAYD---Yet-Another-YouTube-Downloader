# YAYD---Yet-Another-YouTube-Downloader
A little project that I made for downloading youtube videos

## TODO

- [ ] - Due to adaptive streaming most videos don't have audio, need to implement some kind of A/V merging(ffmpeg)

### Required libraries:
 1. python
 2. pytube3

If you're using binaries from [releases](https://github.com/Erikyy/YAYD---Yet-Another-YouTube-Downloader/releases), then you don't need any libraries


### Running the application
Just use `python main.py` to run this application or download binaries from [releases](https://github.com/Erikyy/YAYD---Yet-Another-YouTube-Downloader/releases)
